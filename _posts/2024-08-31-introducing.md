The Story So Far (And Future Plans)

This place will be a great starting line to introduce my drawing pieces and share my thoughts, techniques, discoveries and observations as a painter.

This blog might also greatly help to find a community around my hobby. Instagram is for sure a fantastic tool for that as well, it might help to complete this objective too.
